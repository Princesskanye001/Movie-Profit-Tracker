Movie Profit Tracker
Since I chose data engineering as my elective for the final two months at WeThinkCode_, I saw the need to
create a project that would deepen my understanding of ETL workflows and their practical applications. This
led to the development of Movie Profit Tracker, in this project I:
Developed an ETL pipeline to process movie data from a CSV file.
Extracted raw data, transformed it by calculating movie profits, and loaded the results into a new dataset.
Built a web-based interface using Flask, HTML, and CSS for data visualization and interaction.
Demonstrated proficiency in data engineering workflows and full-stack development integration.
